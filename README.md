#### Platform

We chose web user interface.Building a web browser interface means that any customer on any combination of hardware and operating system can access and maximize their use of your software. If you implement a web browser UI, you can rest assured that your customers will be able to utilize your solution in diverse circumstances.
In the future, if the project is successful, we want to do it on android and ios.

We wrote the backend only in php. We want something new and decided that we would write in JavaEE.Why JavaEE,not php? While comparing the Java vs PHP performance, Java is clearly a winner as it is faster and efficient than PHP to write applications.To database we chose MySQL.Why MySQL?MySQL comes with the advantage of unmatched flexibility that facilitates efficient management of deeply embedded applications, even in gigantic data centers that stack tremendous amounts of mission-critical information.
