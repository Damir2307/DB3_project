We want to make an app where people can book playgrounds. The goal of the project is to save people's time and resources. We offer an application in which you can book a sports field online at a certain hour. Additionally, the project will have sports sections for self-development. And you can make an appointment with the coach at a certain hour. We offer a convenient table and information about the object, such as " whether there is a shower, parking, etc.". And we offer a convenient map that shows its location. For example there is such a problem people cannot know what time is busy what time is free they should call.They have to call to find out if the time is busy, it takes time, even sometimes the operators can be busy and it will be convenient for the owner of the sports ground to accept orders via the Internet In 5 minutes, you will choose the closest one that meets your requirements without calling the operators.We think if this application grows, a lot of people will go in for sports.In our country there is no analogue of such an application.

We have 2 main sections "playground and sports sections". The most convenient thing in our project is a convenient table that shows what time you can book. To calculate from your location, there is also a map . There is a filter for searching.We provide brief but succinct information about the object "size, capacity of people, whether there is Parking". Reviews of people and responses from the administration of the object. Booking by captcha and confirmation by SMS code.

We chose web user interface.Building a web browser interface means that any customer on any combination of hardware and operating system can access and maximize their use of your software. If you implement a web browser UI, you can rest assured that your customers will be able to utilize your solution in diverse circumstances. In the future, if the project is successful, we want to do it on android and ios.

We wrote the backend only in php. We want something new and decided that we would write in JavaEE.Why JavaEE,not php? While comparing the Java vs PHP performance, Java is clearly a winner as it is faster and efficient than PHP to write applications.To database we chose MySQL.Why MySQL?MySQL comes with the advantage of unmatched flexibility that facilitates efficient management of deeply embedded applications, even in gigantic data centers that stack tremendous amounts of mission-critical information.
